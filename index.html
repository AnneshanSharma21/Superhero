        <p>Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
            The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in
            Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Originally named the "Bat-Man,"
            the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight,
            and the World's Greatest Detective.The character became popular soon after his introduction 
            in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, Batman, the following year. As the decades went on,
            different interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used
            a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.
            Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots in 70s, culminating in 1986 with The 
            Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. The success of Warner Bros. Pictures' live-action Batman feature
            films have helped maintain the character's prominence in mainstream culture.<br>

        <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist
           who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the
           murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led
           him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. Wayne 
           averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off 
           his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment in real estate before 
           the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his 
           inherited conglomerate. Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor.
           He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation but is more
           widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the company
           of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an
           active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time.</p>
